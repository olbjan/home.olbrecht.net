# The following enables the Stream component which enables streaming the 
# camera H.264 stream data to a Google Cast device (e.g. Android TV or Google
# Home Hub).
#
# When opening the stream from a picture entity in Lovelace, it is common that
# the stream will not load on first try. This is because the stream component
# requires buffering three full B-frames before sending out data to the 
# endpoint. Depending on source camera this can take between 2 to 30 seconds.
# A stream pre-load will likely be possible with Home Assistant 0.91
