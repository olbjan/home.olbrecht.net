# This package uses the monitor Bluetooth tracking solution by Andrew J Freyer
# You can find it at https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/monitor
# At my place it is running on a single Raspberry Pi Zero W
# Departure Scans are triggered by a Fibaro Door Sensor covering the apartment
# entry door.
#
# I have found other solutions to be less than optimal for my use case as I
# usually exit the apartment and take the elevator to the basement. It thus
# takes quite a while until any other device tracker can reliably and quickly
# update status to not_home.
#
# With monitor I have < 30s latency between exiting the home.
#
# Set monitor.sh behavior_preferences to MQTT Device Tracker by adding option:
# PREF_DEVICE_TRACKER_REPORT=true

# This binary sensor is supposed to determine if the family is at home or away,
# used in a conditional view to show the map on the frontend. Still WIP.
